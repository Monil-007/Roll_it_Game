# Roll_it_Game by Monil Gandhi

It is basically a simple dice rolling game.😁
It is made by using pure Javascript🤗 and offcourse html,css
It is even responsive😎 and it contains many visual effects for good UI experience for users🤩.

The Rules are simple👮‍♂️:

-Game will start with Player 1
-The Player needs to roll dice and the number on dice will be added to current score.
-if the player press hold button then the current score will be added to the original score of that respective player.
-Till then player can continue to roll dice.
-But in between if Dice shows 1 then your current score will become 0 and can't be added to original score and your chance gets over and another players starts game.
-Same all rules with another player.
-And this goes on continous.
-Whoever player first reaches 30 points will win this game.
-The winner of the Game will be highlighted in Black Shade(as i told it has good UI for users😅).
-Even in between the game whoever player has the chance to roll dice will be highlighted with a different shade automatically(again made better UI for users😍).
-Once a player wins just click on new game and enjoy the game once again!!😃

So this is a small but quite good game made by me mainly through Javascript and also contains some handsome UI experience for usersPlay!!
So go play, have fun and enjoy!!😊
